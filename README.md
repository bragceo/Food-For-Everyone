# Food-For-Everyone

## Description 

Food for Everyone is a application that allow users to search for restaurants and menu items based on their specific food allergies. The application would use two server-side APIs:  Yelp API and the Spoonacular API to retrieve restaurant and menu item data, and would allow users to input their food allergies and dietary restrictions. The front-end would be built using HTML, JavaScript, and a CSS framework such as Bulma or Foundation.

## Audience: 

How Many People Have Food Allergies? Researchers estimate that 32 million Americans have food allergies, including 5.6 million children under age 18. That’s one in 13 children, or roughly two in every classroom. As such, this application addresses a very important need.
